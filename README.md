# Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-
# Overview
This project involves developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool using Python. The tool leverages the Tesseract OCR engine and various Python libraries to extract text from images and scanned documents, making it easier to digitize and process text-based information.

# Features
--Image Loading and Processing

Load images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
Preprocess images to enhance OCR accuracy.
--Text Extraction

Use Tesseract OCR engine via the pytesseract library to extract text from images.

--File Handling

Save the extracted text to a file.

# Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: pytesseract, OpenCV, PIL/Pillow, Tkinter/PyQt
OCR Engine: Tesseract
